TwTrk
=====

This is a Sinatra app for syncing your tweets to plurk. It uses MongoDB as the database and designed to run on Heroku, and used code from my other project, TermView, to provide a terminal-like user interface. It's geeky, but it's fun, isn't it? :P The only language provided is Chinese (Taiwan), if you could give me a hand on translating, it would be appreciated.

An instance is deployed on http://twtrk.itsze.ro/. You can use it directly or, if you like, you can start your own instance.

** Please note that your Plurk password will be stored as cleartext. Plurk does not provide any alternative way to authenticate. **
